# TABLET CLASSIFIER

## Task

***Business context***. 

In small pharmaceutical enterprises, tablets are usually packaged in cans by hand. In recent years, small automatic packaging lines have been introduced — they mechanically pack tablets from a large container into small ones. 


***Problem.***

The packaging process is not fully automated, the specialist must double-check each package of tablets. If the wrong pill accidentally gets into the batch, it can harm the patient's health.

***A business task.***

Add automatic quality control via computer vision. To do this, we need to develop an algorithm for recognizing tablets from photos. This is a prototype.

## Data

The data is provided by the Hungarian National Institute of Pharmacy and Nutrition (OGYEI).
The dataset contains images of tablets taken on a monochrome background with different types of lighting and camera angles, as well as classes for them.
